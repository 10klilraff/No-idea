Merge 18/11/2018
	Patchouli reverted to second person only, as only half of her was done and it was rewritten.
Fixes 4/11/2018
	Deleting remnants of the old system, no more %PARSE("You take")% %HIS_HER(MASTER)%.
V4.631 22/9/2018
	Updated to latest.
	Mostly skirt flipping.
Misc 16/9/2018
	Changed system yet again, uses a competent parser now to avoid "%YOU()% pick up %HIS_HER(MASTER)%".
	Will have to go through all of them at some point.
	Suika's and Sakuna's dialog will have to be handled on some other day.
Fix 6/9/2018
	CONJUGATOR returns at some point, meaning it destroys RESULT.

	Also fixed spacing in YOU.

Misc 5/9/2018
	Changing YOU and HE_SHE to also handle verbs using CONJUGATOR - YOU(1,"walk") becomes "you walk" or "player walks".

Misc 2/9/2018
	Gathering, PRINT_STATUS_2
Misc 1/9/2018
	Missed changing, lost to time.
