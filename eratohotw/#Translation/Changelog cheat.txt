Update cheat to v4.740 15/4/2020
    Copied some functions from キャラメイク.ERB as they were renamed and changed when moved to NEWGAME_CUSTOM.ERB

Allow more than 128 characters 26/1/2020
    It was set to 128 as that was MAXCHARA back then, set to 150 now.

Cheat update 6/1/2020
    Moved what used to be in the options menu to the cheat menu.
    Added new cheat for making the tutorial text faster.
    Might make it less condescending later.

Note 5/1/2020
    Removed everything from OPTIONS.ERB aside from the stars, due to the new format.
    Cheats go in CHEATS.ERB.

Time Compression 12/3/2019
    Added toggle to cheat menu allowing for time compression.
    Some actions take less time to perform when time compression is activated.
    Originally by some thread anon or something, the "pat them all" mod.

Fix 5/10/2018
    Unlocked character editor's "next button" no longer crashes game if spammed.

v4.631 21/9/2018
    Merged in translated to avoid the diffing.

Charisma calculation 16/9/2018
    You can now use something other than real-life day to calculate Charisma value, not sure what though.

CFLAG support 14/9/2018
    You can now also change the CFLAG of people - favorability and such.

Multi change 6/9/2018
    You can now change the TCVAR, ABL, TALENT, and EXP of however many people at once.
    It's lacking in documentation, and TCVAR is untranslated, and there are no checks to make sure the game doesn't break.
    Also added TITLES.ERB from translated.
    Fixed tense functions.

v4.630proto
    Added changelog
    Merged in third-person functions from translated
