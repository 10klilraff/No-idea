This file lists functions related to second-third person.
The translation branch itself doesn't use these functions to make third-person possible. It's for use by other branches, primarily feature/third-person.
The character's name will be "Anon" as an example.
The following are parameters:
WHO - Numerical ID for the character, the player as ID 0
	MASTER and PLAYER are both variables that mean 0
CAP - Capitalize, he/He, she/She etc.
	CAP defaults to 0, meaning you just have to write YOU() to get YOU(0). When there are multiple arguments, you can simply skip writing one and it'll become default. I.e. YOU(0,"are") is the same as YOU(,"are")
FORCE - Forces third person, in case it's a moment where someone's clearly talking about the player in third person.
ARGS - Some manual string.

YOU(CAP, ARGS)
	Third person
		Anon
	Second person
		You/you
	You can add several things in place of ARGS, it expects second person.
	YOU(,"are") becomes either "you are" or "Anon is".
	Full list is "are" "aren't" "don't" "haven't" "have" "weren't" "were"
YOU_GRAMMAR(ARGS)
	Miscellaneous function for special verbs and other things.
	"don't" -> "doesn't"

Now the functionality of CONJUGATOR will be described.
It is a function that takes a verb and a tense and applies them if the game is in third person.
CONJUGATOR("speak:s")
	Third person
		speaks
	second person
		speak
etc. 
It accepts ":ing", ":s", and ":ed" and applies ongoing- third person- or past tense respectively. There might be some verbs that go awry.
