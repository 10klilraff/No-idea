Basically, if you want a waifu who can react to something specific, look it up here.
No spoilers naturally, but still.
A number (1-10) after is roughly how complete something is, 1 is "barely anything", 10 is "complete set across the board", 11 is "this will never be translated".

Lines
Non-speech lines are as follows
PRINTFORMDW [^「（]|PRINTFORMDL [^「（]|PRINTFORMD [^「（]|PRINTFORM [^「（]|PRINTFORML [^「（]|PRINTFORMW [^「（]|DATAFORM [^「（]
Speech are as follows
 [「（]
so not 100% accurate, but at least 95%
The thing is that speech-lines are much, much easier to translate than non-speech lines.

Currently covers the following:
Mark acquisition text
Counter - Related to actions they do on their own
Gender - Futa and such
Sex friend
Slut
Child raising
Time stop
Sleep rape
Lines that are speech
Lines that are not speech

Glossary:
Counter - when you're pushed down, but also when they do stuff to you, like, walk up next to you.
Difficulty - The higher percentage of spoken dialog a character has, the easier they are to translate, generally. 0 is nightmare that doesn't speak, and 10 can be done in less than a week.
