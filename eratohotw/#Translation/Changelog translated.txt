			Iku Nagae got new dialog.
		New experience - dancing exp.
		New item - Stone of Midara, lets you seek physical relationships more easily.
		5 TCVAR used to keep track of multipliers applied to certain commands, e.g. "all C commands increased" and similar.
		When stealing new panties, the text is pink.
		Assistant bonus is now applied to cooking.
		When starting a new game you can pick a bonus.
		You can now offer the Fortune-Teller's underwear to god (but you can no longer try to save him).
		The game no longer asks if Aya should fly around in her reporter's costume.
		10 or so bras were added (Iku's top and Shou's top don't work, they just display as "0").
		Characters with dialog have colored names in the abilities display (currently broken as it shows everyone's colored, please wait warmly).

	English changes:
		Changelogs will now be created in each branch to help organize things, and to answer questions like "what has been added since X?"
		Some branches will be merged into QoL since they've been proven stable. Not all though since if only one feature in QoL is implemented by the Japanese, it'll be annoying to merge.
		A new system for third-person writing is added. The functions are in translated, but aren't used there. Using them in feature branches isn't required, but highly recommended.
		Feature/titles will be merged into translated, but using a function instead of CSVs.
