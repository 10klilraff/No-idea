There's a lot of overlap going on between Additions and QoL, so let's try to clarify it a bit.
QoL is mainly for UI and display tweaks to show information that isn't available, but should be.
Small tweaks also go there (Example: showing a button for a feature that's already in the game, etc)

Additions is for major gameplay additions and gameplay tweaks in general.
