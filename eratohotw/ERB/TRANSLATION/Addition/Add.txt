@強くてニューゲーム.ERB, @Add_TSP_INCREASE.ERB
	Feature to sacrifice player's maxed skills (lv5-6) in order to gain a permanent boost to TSP during NG+
	This is so that you can get something for your trouble if you decide to reset your exp and abilities
	
@HININSHITE.ERB, @Add_FudeOroshiRaw.ERB
	Option to beg characters to let them have you raw sex when it's player's first time having sex (checks for male virginity)
	Way easier check compared to normal one, slutty and easy girls should let you do it right away
	Added explanations for grayed out contraception options
	
@Add_COMF620 鈴奈庵.ERB, @Item.csv, @SOURCE.ERB
	Replaces COMF620 for Suzunaan. Improves interface, adds interaction from Kosuzu.
	Adds new features: allow to borrow two-three books at once if the player is close with Kosuzu, borrow a book that's not available, extend the lending period.
	Adds Demon Book that increases gained sexual experience. For that reason it was moved to Addition
	
@贈り物.ERB
	Slightly increases chances of getting a gift from the character by 1 per 10k favor (10 max)
	
@COMF850 抜け出す.ERB
	Feature to slip out using TSP when another character pushes the player down
	
@COMF411 戦闘訓練.ERB
	Randomly increases player's max STA/ENE when training under harsh weather (downpour, blizzard, blazing summer sun during the day)
	
@COMF413 料理を作る.ERB, COMF414 食事を取る.ERB, @Add_LewdFoodAdd.ERB
	Feature to mix in lewd bodily fluids into the food and feed other characters with it
	
@COMF480 弾幕勝負.ERB, DANMAKU.ERB
	Give extra experience to the player for beating characters of the similar skill level without losing lives and/or using bombs (using RESULT:9-RESULT:10 for passing the result)
	Add 3 extra kojo calls for danmaku dialogue: エピタフ失敗 - when epitaph/king crimson fails, エピタフ成功 - when succeeds, Pichun - when you get hit (using RESULT:8 to check player's remaining lives)
	
@Add_COMF425 薬を盛る.ERB

	Prevent Aya from snitching on you if you're lovers
	
@SOURCE_マイナス.ERB, TRACHECK_ORGASM.ERB
	Check TCVAR for current counter action to prevent unnecessary hostility build up when target initiates the action from COUNTER
	Additionally lowers hostility build up when target orgasms during self-initiated commands
	The side effect seems that whenever characters run any counter effect, it will greatly lower the negative effect of your current action, which is exploitable
	But hey, it's better than constant hate marks, right? Plus, if character is engaging in counter, that means they're already pretty much making out with you
		Additionally tweaked spontaneous lactations, added slight boosts to [fuck buddy] (sex friend) which previously only applied to Debauched/Lewd (Unused?)
	
@COMF618 花屋.ERB, @ADD_BuyMoreFields
