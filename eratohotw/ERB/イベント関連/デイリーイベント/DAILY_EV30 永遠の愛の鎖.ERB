PRINTFORMDW "My husband, my dear husband"—You hear a sickly sweet voice, alongside a pleasurable feeling wrapped around your manhood.
PRINTFORMDW The sensation intensifies as it withdraws upwards, the folds clinging tightly to your glans.
PRINTFORMDW Even so, when it pushes back downwards, it is ever so softly, and you feel your tip press against a cervix—almost as if letting the two kiss deeply.
PRINTFORMDW You don't need to open your eyes to know that the source comes from Kaguya.
PRINTFORMDL 
IF CFLAG:MASTER:現在位置 == 414
	PRINTFORMDW Your body feels extremely heavy—Your eyes opening slowly reveals a bare-naked Kaguya, smiling down at you delightfully.
	PRINTFORMDW You ask her what she's doing so early into the wee hours of the morning, and she replies that she was desperately in need of you.
	PRINTFORMDW In this moment of time, where for some reason it feels as if everything had lost its vividness.
	PRINTFORMDW No matter what you do, your body feels like it's sinking. Attempting to move your limbs feels as difficult as if you were still dreaming.
ELSE
	PRINTFORMDW Your body feels extremely heavy—Your eyes opening slowly reveals a bare-naked Kaguya, smiling down at you delightfully.
	PRINTFORMDW You ask her what brings her here, as you survey your surroundings—in this moment of time where it feels as if everything had lost its vividness.
	PRINTFORMDW You wonder if you were brought outside, as you think you could feel some sort of underbrush on your bare skin.
	PRINTFORMDW Kaguya replies that she was desperately in need of you, and she wishes for you to forgive her.
	PRINTFORMDW You wonder if you could have possibly been neglecting her recently or something.
	PRINTFORMDW No matter what you do, your body feels like it's sinking. Attempting to move your limbs feels as difficult as if you were still dreaming.
ENDIF
PRINTFORMDW With your head hazy, and your body heavy, you indeed decide to interpret this as a dream. A dream that was unlike a dream, but a dream nonetheless.
SIF !TALENT:62:恋人
	PRINTFORMDW Besides, Kaguya has never addressed you as her husband or anything, so it made sense.
PRINTFORMDL 
PRINTFORMDW The way Kaguya uses her hips—her writhing figure on top of you—she enthusiastically gives your shaft the most exquisite pleasure you've ever felt.
PRINTFORMDW Are you enjoying this?, she asks in a strained voice, a tone that was a mixture of lust and affection.
PRINTFORMDW You nod, and Kaguya's movements intensify even further.
PRINTFORMDW %BREAKENG(@"Just how long has she been at this, you wonder. Semen overflows from where your manhood connects with her slit, creating to be what looks like an erotic mess.")%
PRINTFORMDL 
PRINTFORMDW Thinking back on it, you have been spending quite a lot of time with other women lately. A little bit of guilt wells up.
PRINTFORMDW She didn't seem to mind, and she didn't seem too angry, but that doesn't mean that she wasn't jealous.
PRINTFORMW 「Aahn♥ My husband—♥ Nnhhh――♥♥」
PRINTFORMDW Her hips slam down onto yours, her insides clamping around you as her lower abdomen repeatedly contracts.
PRINTFORMDW %BREAKENG(@"Your glans press tightly against the entrance to Kaguya's womb as you begin to fill it once again with your cum, your ejaculation matched rhythmically by her own orgasmic convulsions.")%
PRINTFORMDL 
PRINTFORMDW Even at the peak of her own climax, her body still moves clearly for your pleasure, and yours alone.
PRINTFORMDW As a clear sign of her deep affection for you, Kaguya becomes a dutiful wife in all meanings.
PRINTFORMDW After a while passes, Kaguya lays down on top of you, her chest heaving and trying to catch her breath.
PRINTFORMDW As you attempt to caress her head, her vaginal walls once again contracts around your shaft.
PRINTFORMDL 
PRINTFORMW 「My dear, beloved husband... Do you love Kaguya?」
PRINTFORMDW You reply that of course you do, and once again you feel a sharp contraction around your meat.
;どちらにせよ好感度２００００で否とは言えまい。
IF TALENT:62:恋人
	PRINTFORMW 「But, Kaguya can't help but feel uneasy. I'm worried that my beloved husband will find someone he loves more than me.」
	PRINTFORMDW You tell her that there was no need to worry about something like that, and Kaguya nods in agreement.
	PRINTFORMDL 
	PRINTFORMW 「I believe that your love to me is no mere whim... It is true love, and I fully think that.」
	PRINTFORMW 「The day that you accepted me... I have not forgotten a single word of what you had said at that time.」
	PRINTFORMW 「That's why I... am not against you getting close with other women.」
	PRINTFORMDW ――As long as my dear husband returns to Kaguya's side.
	PRINTFORMDL 
	PRINTFORMDW You ask what Kaguya has brought with her, just now noticing the object.
	PRINTFORMDW Kaguya picks up a small jar, and pours the contents of whatever is inside into her mouth.
	PRINTFORMDW Then, she brings her face closer to yours and pours the contents into your mouth with a kiss.
	PRINTFORMDW A sweet, viscous liquid.
	PRINTFORMDW She holds your face still, so that you can't move or escape—You could swear her eyes had a strange glow to them.
	PRINTFORMDL 
	PRINTFORMDW You have some sort of bad feeling about this.
	PRINTFORMDW However, you are unable to do anything as the strange haze in your head continues, and you are forced to drink.
	PRINTFORMDW You gradually begin to feel incredibly intoxicated, the insides of your chest burns as it spreads and seeps into your entire body.
	PRINTFORMDW Finally, Kaguya releases your mouth, and stares at you with an expression full of affection and obsession.
	PRINTFORMDL 
	PRINTFORMW 「I asked Eirin to assist me with this.」
	PRINTFORMDW With what, you ask. With a beautiful smile, she replies—with making the Hourai Elixir.
	PRINTFORMDL 
	PRINTFORMW 「I knew that I shouldn't be doubting you, but I was still filled with anxiety...」
	PRINTFORMW 「Pray forgive your foolish wife... However, never again will I doubt you.」
	PRINTFORMW 「Even if you find a partner you love more than Kaguya, I am fine with that.」
	PRINTFORMW 「Even if Kaguya is your number two, or even your number three, I will accept it all as a momentary whim.」
	PRINTFORMW 「The others will all decay eventually, after all.」
	PRINTFORMDL 
	PRINTFORMDW Like a madwoman, Kaguya begins to alternate between constricting your penis and caressing it.
	PRINTFORMDW It's painful, but even that pain is mixed with pleasure.
	PRINTFORMDL 
	PRINTFORMW 「My dear husband, you will eternally be Kaguya's spouse.」
	PRINTFORMW 「And Kaguya, will also eternally be yours.」
	PRINTFORMW 「A wavering heart no longer scares me. Your momentary vow has now become a part of the eternal.」
ELSE
	PRINTFORMW 「Kaguya too. Kaguya loves her dear husband so, so very much...」
	PRINTFORMDW I am so in love with you, she adds.
	PRINTFORMDL 
	IF TALENT:MASTER:恋人
		PRINTFORMW 「I do not mind that you love someone else, I do not mind playing second fiddle.」
		PRINTFORMDW But, I just can't bear the thought of losing my dear husband someday.
		PRINTFORMDW Kaguya continues to speak, caressing your cheeks and looking as if she's about to cry.
	ELSE
		PRINTFORMW 「...I'm afraid of losing you one day, my dear husband.」
		PRINTFORMDW Looking as if she were about to cry from just the thought of it, Kaguya caresses your cheek.
	ENDIF
	PRINTFORMDL 
	PRINTFORMW 「I want to forever be by your side.」
	PRINTFORMW 「I don't care about whom else you love, nor about whom you prefer.」
	PRINTFORMW 「As long as you spend the same time with Kaguya, anything is fine.」
	PRINTFORMDW ――If you could spend the same eternity as Kaguya, then that's all that matters.

	PRINTFORMW 「If that is true, then you wouldn't want to leave Kaguya to grieve by herself, right?」
	PRINTFORMW 「But, I don't want to lose you to some unforeseen circumstances, or even your natural lifespan...」
	PRINTFORMW 「So, I thought I should give you the Hourai Elixir.」
