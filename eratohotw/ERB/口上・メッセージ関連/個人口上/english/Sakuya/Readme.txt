For EraToho The World, Sakuya Izayoi by some /hgg/ anon

About this
	The dialog is mainly intended for a butler living in the SDM, but other plays should be supported
	
	I tried to go for a Sakuya who is portrayed as a kuudere ojousama/mature maid character who sometimes makes cheeky remarks. 
	She acts coldly towards the player at first and tries to correct the player's inappropriate behaviour, especially if you live in the mansion. 
	She genuinely cares about her role as a head maid for Remilia and takes it very seriously.
	She becomes more loving and teasing as she begins to loves you and uses her timestop to tease the player sometimes.
	(Toggleable) On hate mark 3 or angry + mad she becomes very distant to the player and will make cutting remarks and throw knives at you.
