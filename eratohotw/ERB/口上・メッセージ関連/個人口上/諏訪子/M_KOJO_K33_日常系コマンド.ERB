		PRINTFORMDW Pulling her hat over her eyes by the brim, Suwako blurts this out of nowhere with her mouth turning upwards in a cheeky grin.
		PRINTFORMDW A lukewarm breeze rustles through the air. You can't help but wonder what kind of "power" was contained in those words.
		PRINTFORMDW ......
		PRINTFORMDL For a while, you couldn't say a word back and could barely manage to bring forth some saliva to quench your parched throat.
		PRINTFORMDW ...This level of tension was enough to grab hold of your heart. No, in fact, you may have already been caught.
		PRINTFORMDW You attempt to keep your composure and play dumb, however... Suwako's expression hasn't changed one bit.
		PRINTFORML 「Hmm～? Let's see... For example, let's say you can stop time and the like. And then you do all sort of nasty stuff in there.
		PRINTFORMW 　Or maybe, you can move at superhuman speed, or skip time somehow. Well, the exact details are not known to me.」
		PRINTFORMDW An almost accurate analysis. It appears that she had been steadily revealing your abilities behind the facade of a nonchalant relationship.
		PRINTFORMDL ...In the meantime, let's try to be brave and ask her if she has any evidence to support her wild claims.
		PRINTFORMDW If you can just get through this by claiming it a hoax or a downright lie, and wait until things calm down, you might have it in the bag――
		PRINTFORMW 「Evidence? Oh, if it's the evidence that you seek――」
		PRINTFORMW 「――Why don't we just ask you about that?」

		PRINTFORMW 「Those are the curses carved deep upon that soul of yers. There's no way I'd mistake it for something else!」
		PRINTFORMDW You see Suwako looking down at you with a peering gaze. The look on her face doesn't look like a girl's at all anymore.
		PRINTFORMW 「Fu-fu-fu... Ya still gonna play innocent on me, hmm?」
		PRINTFORMDL Glaring down upon the ground from a great height was the piercing gaze of a cruel curse god.
		PRINTFORMDW She had the air of absolute power, as if she were looking down on a worm that she could crush underfoot at any moment.
		PRINTFORMDW ...But you can only curse your own misfortune. You had a bad match-up and picked a fight with a wrong person, to say the least.
		PRINTFORMW 「Now theeen. What shall we do with ya... I wonder if I can make the name of Moriya Shrine even more famous by publicizing this fact～?」

		PRINTFORMW ――"I think it might be a perfect opportunity to start terrorizing Gensokyo soon, y'know?"
		PRINTL 
		PRINTFORMDW She really just whispered such a crazy thing in your ear in an amusing way, as if she was revealing a treasure.
		PRINTFORMW 「Ku-ku... There ya have it. So if things turn out that way――of course, you'll be there to help us, right?」
		PRINTFORMDW With a very cheerful, and wickedly "good" smile at that, Suwako pats you on the shoulder.

						DATAFORM These iron rings? I'd like to view them as elaborate hula-hoops, you see. They've been quite handy for a lot of stuff.
						DATAFORM It's not like I'm that much of a close friend with Kanako though. It's an undesirable, but... inseparable relationship, should I call it?
						DATAFORM When I first started receivin' complaints from certain activists concerning the sacrificial frog rituals, that's when I realized that the times have become very troublesome indeed.
						DATAFORM Layin' down the groundwork and preparin' the soil is my specialty. It's an essential faculty for a large-scale construction, don'tcha think?♪
						DATAFORM Someone stubbed their toe on a dresser's corner? Maybe their daily routine brought a curse, who knows?
						DATAFORM "The spirit you do not approach shall not curse you", or so the saying goes... I for one would still insist on cursing though, for not showing the respect that is.
						DATAFORM The threat of nature taking shape is the basis of our form. Never forget how terrible disasters may be lest you regret it, 'kay?
						DATAFORM The very idea of conquering nature and bringing it under control is total hogwash to me. You never know when and where a natural disaster will strike. "God only knows" is exactly the right saying for it.
						
						;added
						DATAFORM Kanako, huh? Yeah, like I said we got along since then. I can't say I wasn't upset with her at first, but it's silly to hold a grudge for eternity like that. Not to mention that she's a lot of fun to pull a prank on♪
						DATAFORM So you know that Kanako supposedly took my shrine away, right? But it's not exactly like that. In the end it still technically belongs to me and I'm the one maintaining it. Kanako is the front face of the whole operation and she's quite good at it. She always gets stuff done in a timely manner.
						DATAFORM Sanae... Yeah, she's very precious to me. I get to have sort of a granddaughter again, isn't that just great? It brings me back to the good old days too...
						DATAFORM Having me, Kanako and Sanae all together like that\@ TALENT:恋慕 ? , and now you too#\@, it feels almost like family... Perhaps that's the happiest I've been in a long while. No wonder I got so soft over the years, hahaha!
						DATAFORM How come I have the appearance of a little girl unlike Kanako? Well, let's just say that it's demanding to keep up my true form for any prolonged period of time, and besides... My current looks attract new believers way more easily, fufu.
						DATAFORM I used to look quite ferocious in the past... It's a duty of a God to invoke the necessary awe and respect when others are in their presence. But maybe that outlook was a little immature on my part.
						DATAFORM Love! Genuine love for their cute little goddess is what moves hearts and turns people into profound believers... Maybe Kanako will discover that one day herself, hmm? Hehe.
						DATAFORM Gods live because of the people. It's the faith they give that supports me, that nourishes me. Gods and humans allow each other to live. Together we advance, together we live... I always wished that someday people will be able to walk with me as equals. Maybe, soon...
						DATAFORM You think I'm unusually kind for a God? Mmm, I guess I mellowed out considerably over the years, yeah～ I figured it's a waste of energy to get seriously upset over every little thing after all. Besides, life is too short for humans, and they always seek to mend their ways with me. Nah, curses totally have nothing to do with thaaat, c'mon～
						DATAFORM You like my hair and it smells nice? Hehe, thaaanks～ Sanae's been busy bringin' all sorts of cosmetics for us, so our womanly charms are on point like never before. You better watch out～
						DATAFORM Maaan, you can't make light of today's humans, can you～ They'll retaliate and it's always so awesome! These times sure are a lot of fun♪
						DATAFORM After losing much of our faith in the Outside World, people have stopped seeing and hearing us completely... Those were some long, lonesome times... But it's different now, yup!
						DATAFORM What determines what's good or bad? Hm, that's an odd question, but well... Let's say, a God comes over, like me. Would you be embarrassed to show me something that you'd want to hide? Then it's probably bad, yup! It's not ideal by any means, but it's a decent rule of thumb I'd say.

					DATAFORM Devout believers are very welcome. %SPLIT_G("It's never late to convert if you feel like it, y'know?:Feel free to convert any time, 'kay?")%
					DATAFORM I've been takin' a lot of steps to boost our faith, but I think I'm doing well on that one for the time being.
					DATAFORM I tried to get those kappa to build us a dam, but it didn't work out so well in the end. It wasn't very team-oriented it turns out.
					DATAFORM My element is Kun of the eight trigrams... Meaning that I'm a Goddess who has the means of creating the Earth. Cool, innit?
					DATAFORM A God can inhabit anythin'. Even a piece of rock or a tree for example, can represent the divine with enough concept behind it and thoughts put into it. In other words, faith!
					DATAFORM Strictly speaking, my existence is a little different from a divine spirit. Well, it doesn't take away the fact that I'm still a Goddess.
					DATAFORM ...Say, about your tea... Where exactly does it even come from?
					DATAFORM Before I moved to Gensokyo, I was ruling over other gods in my native land. Well, that's the short version that's usually told anyways.
					DATAFORM Whoa there, it's better that you don't take god's name in vain, especially that one. And when you do, mind your manners and use the "-sama" suffix if you don't wanna get cursed, got it?
					DATAFORM I've got a lot of similarities to a frog you say? Well, maybe because there's a very good basis for that one after all.
					DATAFORM I'm sometimes referred to as an amphibian goddess. I'd say it's about half and half when it comes to a correct interpretation... If I had to guess.
					DATAFORM Speaking of bunrei, or a divisible spirit. Sort of an enshrining, I guess. Well, the thing is that gods are infinitely dividable since their power won't be affected and all. Thus, Gods may split their spirits and manifest wherever called on.
					DATAFORM I remember attempting to bring about the energy revolution to Youkai Mountain via the introduction of a nuclear fusion... But I guess I misplaced my hopes a little.
					DATAFORM The Underground Geyser Center located under the base of the mountain is actually our facility where various kappa perform experiments and research on nuclear fusion based on our technology.
					DATAFORM Hisoutensoku? Ahh, you mean that giant advertising balloon inflated via steam coming from the Underground Geyser Center. That's my work, by the way.
					DATAFORM Thanks to the completion of the cableway, people can easily visit the mountain shrine directly from the Village, and it resulted in a huge influx over there, y'know.
					DATAFORM I tried to serve as a tour guide to commemorate the grand opening of our cableway, and maaan... It's been a huge success, I'm tellin' ya!
					DATAFORM When I first arrived at Gensokyo, I had quite a hard time gatherin' any faith back then.
					DATAFORM You wanna know why I moved here? While I was already a goddess in the outside world, the belief in gods quickly started to come out of fashion in the society over there, so that's that.
					DATAFORM Science and technology goin' hand in hand with religion... While not exactly incompatible, it's deemed that they don't mesh well with each other, I guess.
					DATAFORM Those tengu guys, well they are a demanding bunch to say the least. I wonder if our bargain still holds up in the future...
					DATAFORM As for kappa, we have sort of a... symbiosis with 'em, to put it that way I s'pose? We've been receiving their cooperation when it comes to technological advancements after all.
					DATAFORM God is the one who holds the reverence of men together and lends them a portion of His power. Well, I guess you could say it comes down to the importance of a fair trade.
					;this won't work as is, so do something similar
					DATAFORM I'd prefer that you don't take the God's name and the like in vain, y'know～ You don't wanna get cursed, right?
					DATAFORM It's a good idea to show your respect for all things in nature and around you. A healthy sense of humility will help you in all things.
					DATAFORM Don't take the gods lightly, 'kay? Here in Gensokyo, you can end up being on the receiving end of the full extent of their divine power after all.
					
					;added
					DATAFORM It's believed that religion and faith inherently holds people back in terms of progress, but I don't think so. It's good when you can go back to the cozy old ways at any time if you seek to find solace, but I digress. The point is that it's also important to keep up with the times though, of course while preserving all the important traditions.
					DATAFORM When the sun rises in the east, all nature - mountains, rivers, trees and grasses - all turn themselves to the sun. It's the essence of life and love.
