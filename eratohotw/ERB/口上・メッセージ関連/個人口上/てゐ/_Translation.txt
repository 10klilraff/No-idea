Translations by W65:

Based on version 4660proto

I tried to stay close to the original Japanese except when I couldn't correctly translate what appeared to be idiomatic expression. I expanded on some already-written lines in order to remove some onomatopoeia from dialog, and to expand on some sex acts.

Tewi's voice appears to be casual and kinda generic. She uses a lot of "however" or "therefore" ("だから" I think) at the end of her lines, which I didn't try to capture in her voice. When she's being deceitful or lying or scamming, she seems to tend to add "ウサ" (the first two characters of rabbit) at the end of her lines as a verbal tic. I didn't try to capture this tic.

The Japanese notes say she feels a little tsundere (didn't detect that myself), smell-sensitive, and a little emotionally unstable (okay what). Also other crap I can't translate right.
