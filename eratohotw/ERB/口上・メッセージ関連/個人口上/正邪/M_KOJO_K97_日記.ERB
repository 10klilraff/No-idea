;日記口上
;使うなら@M_KOJO_K97(ARG)のCALL DIARY_BEFORE_CHECK_K97のコメントアウトを外すこと。
;例によってK97をKキャラ番号、XXをキャラ番号に置換してね。
;旧テンプレにはないのでその場合は該当箇所に追記しましょう。

;一日の終了時の流れ

;◆日記の仕様◆
;※１@DIARY_BEFORE_CHECK_K97で日記のフラグが立つ。
;→未読フラグ(2)が立っていると一日の終わりにデイリーイベントとして日記が読まれる（既読になる）。
;→※２未読フラグ(3)が立っていると[日記を読む]で読む事ができる。読むと既読(1)になる。
;※１各所イベント口上やコマンド口上でフラグを立たせても良いです。
;※２基本的には未読(2)推奨です。既読(1)、未読(3)はワンステップ必要。

;[日記を読む]には、持ち主が[恋慕]なら自由に読むことができ、
;そうでない場合は恋慕でない人物がその場に居ない時、もしくは時間停止することで盗み読みできる。
;拠点住民でないキャラは恋慕であれば自宅（お招き部屋）で読むことができる。

;MAX_DIARY_PAGE:XX　キャラ番号XXの日記の最大ページ数　限度は101（1～100）
;DIARY:XX:YY　　　　キャラ番号XXの日記番号YYの情報
;　　 3=未読　　　　デイリーイベントで読まれない。[日記を読む]で読むと既読になる。
;　　 2=未読　　　　デイリーイベントで読まれる。読まれるまでは[日記を読む]では読めない。読まれると既読になる。
;　　 1=既読　　　　デイリーイベントで読まれない。[日記を読む]で読める。
;　　 0=読めない　　未解禁。
;PAGESET:XX:YY　　　キャラ番号XXの実際に書かれたYYページ目の日記番号。

@DIARY_K97_EXIST
;存在判定
;0だと日記は書かれません。
;=============================
RETURN 1

;=============================
@DIARY_AFTER_CHECK_K97
;デイリーイベントで日記が読まれた際の後処理。
;フラグの管理等自由に扱って良い。

;条件フラグのリセットや判定追加もここに 
;たとえば：今日構ったフラグ
;今日構った日記が表示した後、構ったフラグをリセット。
; CFLAG:XX:今日構ったフラグ = 0
;あるいは何かの状態が続くことがフラグの場合
;例：好感度がほぼ変わらない日が続くと
;「あなた」の態度が冷たいな～みたいな日記を書く
; SIF CFLAG:XX:好感度 <= LAST_LP+3
;   NOTOUCH_DAY ++
;=============================


;=============================
@DIARY_BEFORE_CHECK_K97
;常時チェックされる日記の状態情報。
;ここでDIARY:XX:YYの更新を行う。
;※DIARY:XX:0番は使えません。

;ここで汎用発生条件を記入する
;コマンド別の発生条件はM_KOJOの各ファイル中で追加してください。

;基本的に発生条件には"DIARY:XX:YY == 0"を入れること。
;そうしないと同じ日記が書かれたりしてしまう。

;DIARY:XX:YY　　　　キャラ番号XXの日記番号YYの情報
;　　 3=未読　　　　デイリーイベントで読まれない。[日記を読む]で読むと既読になる。
;　　 2=未読　　　　デイリーイベントで読まれる。読まれるまでは[日記を読む]では読めない。読まれると既読になる。
;　　 1=既読　　　　デイリーイベントで読まれない。[日記を読む]で読める。
;　　 0=読めない　　未解禁。

;○未読(2)にする場合（基本）
;未読(2)にするとデイリーイベントとして発生し、一日の終わりに１つだけ読まれる。
;複数のページが未読(2)になっている場合は番号が小さいものが読まれ、それ以外はリセット(0)される。
;その為、複数同時に発生すると、発生したのに読まれずリセットされる場合もある。
;未読(2)にするには単純にフラグに2を入れるだけで良い。

;例１)初対面
;SIF DIARY:XX:YY == 0 && CFLAG:XX:面識
;	DIARY:XX:YY = 2

;○未読(3)にする場合（応用）
;未読(3)にするとデイリーイベントとして読まれず、書かれた時点で[日記を読む]によって読めるようになる。
;プレイヤーが自主的に読まない限り読まれず、一日に複数ページ加筆される場合もある。
;未読(3)にするにはフラグに3を入れた上で、CALL CHARA_DIARY_PAGESETTING(XX, YY)をする必要がある。

;例２）好感度100以上
;IF DIARY:XX:YY == 0 && CFLAG:XX:好感度 >= 100
;	DIARY:XX:YY = 3
;	CALL CHARA_DIARY_PAGESETTING(XX, YY)
;ENDIF

;例３）例２の日記が読まれた上で好感度1000以上
;これをするとYYを読んだ直後にZZが書き込まれることも起こる。
;IF DIARY:XX:ZZ == 0 && DIARY:XX:YY == 1 && CFLAG:XX:好感度 >= 1000
;	DIARY:XX:ZZ = 3
;	CALL CHARA_DIARY_PAGESETTING(XX, ZZ)
;ENDIF

;▽おせっかいな注釈
;ファーストキスは基本的に全員[キス未経験]を所持しているので、"!TALENT:XX:キス未経験"で判定できます。
;デート帰りのキスで分岐したいならデート帰りのキス口上でフラグを立てます。
;その場合、通常のファーストキス喪失と重複しないように気をつけましょう。
;処女喪失は初期設定で処女喪失している場合もあるので、処女喪失口上の方でフラグを立てた方が良いです。
;その他告白・陥落等のイベントは各種イベント口上でフラグを立てます。初対面はそっちでも大丈夫です。
;日付を正確に測るには別途フラグが必要です。例えば初めて会った日とか。

	CASE 1
		PRINTFORML Dear diary,
		PRINTFORMDL
		PRINTFORML Today is the very first time I'm going to write here. This might be a folly, but it's still a fun and productive way to spend time.
		PRINTFORML I decided that it'd be a good idea to pour my soul on these pages so that I could calm the turmoil inside me at least a bit.
		PRINTFORML It's a great idea to review myself from the side many days later with fresh mind and better hindsight. Or at least I hope so.
		PRINTFORMDL
		PRINTFORML But first, I gotta make sure none of my enemies can read this. Don't want to make it too easy now, do we?
		PRINTFORML So if you're not a complete moron, I'm sure you can get past a simple test. If you managed to crack the code, congratulations.
		PRINTFORML I suppose you deserve to know what's going on in my heart.
		PRINTFORMDL
		PRINTFORML This concludes my first entry.
	CASE 2
		PRINTFORML Dear diary,
		PRINTFORMDL 
		PRINTFORML Every day I try to convert more people to my cause. It's my struggle.
		PRINTFORML But it all seems in vain. It's as if they're only approaching me to heckle and make fun of me.
		PRINTFORML Never once did I seem to change someone's mind yet. I've my share of debates, although my words fail to reach them.
		PRINTFORML Is my method at fault here? Or is it my poor reputation?
		PRINTFORML People just seem to be content with whatever they have right now, and it doesn't make sense to me.
		PRINTFORML However I'm not giving up. I know that the strong ones aren't as powerful as they seem.
		PRINTFORML They can be beaten.
	CASE 3
		PRINTFORML Dear diary,
		PRINTFORML
		PRINTFORML Today I got in trouble. Noticing my moderate success at soapbox speeches, I was immediately silenced and beaten into submission.
		PRINTFORML Though I managed to escape thankfully.
		PRINTFORML Worst of all, I realized that my cheat items no longer work. Well, most of them.
		PRINTFORML Without their help, I don't stand a chance in my current sorry state.
		PRINTFORML This calls to a change of strategy if I want to survive. First, I will no longer show up at public spaces at all during the day.
		PRINTFORML It may limit the exposure of my ideas to the people, but at the same time I can gradually create my own clique of the most loyal of members.
		PRINTFORML Next, I'm making a new hideout at an unspecified spot. It's hidden in plain sight basically.
		PRINTFORML It's such a great place too, even the gap hag will struggle to find me there, I'm sure.
		PRINTFORML Well, good luck me. As long as I am alive, I will make it.
	CASE 4
		PRINTFORML Dear diary,
		PRINTFORML
		PRINTFORML My attempts at making a loyal group of fellow youkai with similar ideas don't seem to work out very well.
		PRINTFORML I have regular visitors and I do get a vocal support sometimes, but it's just that. Words words words, no action at all.
		PRINTFORML They'll be all for abolishing the current powers and starting an uprising right now,
		PRINTFORML but the very next day I see them being buddy-buddy with the humans at the village.
		PRINTFORML It's all so tiresome.
		PRINTFORML I even got spotted by a gap hag the other day during my canvassing session. She did nothing at all. Heck, she even waved at me!
		PRINTFORML They don't see me as a threat anymore. I'm just a sad clown making silly shows for wannabe rebels. What a laugh.
	CASE 5
		PRINTFORML Dear diary,
		PRINTFORML
		PRINTFORML I spoke with Princess the other day. Well, Shinmyoumaru... I got approached.
		PRINTFORML She's so tiny now. She still has the Miracle Mallet, but she barely uses it, not even for making herself larger.
		PRINTFORML As it stands, I don't see her as potential help at all. Living with that shrine maiden in a cage like some pet did a number on her.
		PRINTFORML No, rather, she was always like this. Yes, I'm a bit bitter.
		PRINTFORML But at the same time, I can't bring myself to rely on her again. It's too embarrassing.
		PRINTFORML I just have to get it all done by myself now. I gotta.
		PRINTFORML I gotta...
		PRINTFORML I have to...
	CASE 6
		PRINTFORML Dear diary,
		PRINTFORML
		PRINTFORML Today I met with a human. And boy, what a weird human that was!
		PRINTFORML Apparently %HE_SHE(MASTER)% calls %HIMSELF_HERSELF(MASTER)% %CALLNAME:MASTER%. No doubt a fake name. Or is it?
		PRINTFORML For some reason I couldn't shake off the feeling that %HE_SHE(MASTER)%'s up to something.
		PRINTFORML So I approached %HIM_HER(MASTER,,1)% right away. Really, I'm too blunt about those things sometimes.
		PRINTFORML Well, it's not every day that you meet a human like this, I just couldn't hold back.
		IF CFLAG:1300
			PRINTFORML %HE_SHE(MASTER,1)% was kinda amiable in that regard. Sweet. I think we'll get along just fine.
		ELSE
			PRINTFORML Kinda got rejected. Oh well, whatever. %HE_SHE(MASTER,1)% doesn't seem to have a desire to harm me, so I'll let it slide.
		ENDIF
		PRINTFORML
		PRINTFORML On that note, I didn't even sense a hint of fear from %HIM_HER(MASTER,,1)%. Am I that non-threatening?
		PRINTFORML Nah. %HE_SHE(MASTER, 1)% seems to be hanging out with other youkai no problem. What gives?
		PRINTFORML And %HE_SHE(MASTER)%'s gotta know they're not human too. There's something fishy about this %PRINT_MALE("guy", MASTER)%.
		PRINTFORML I have a hunch for that stuff, I can tell. Guess I'll keep watch on %HIM_HER(MASTER,,1)% for the time being.
		PRINTFORML Maybe it's just my imagination? It better be.
	CASE 7
		PRINTFORML Dear diary,
		PRINTFORML
		PRINTFORML Today I learned that the %PRINT_MALE("guy", MASTER)% I met the other day, right? Get this:
		PRINTFORML %HE_SHE(MASTER, 1)%'s a giant freaking pervert! No, seriously!
		PRINTFORML I caught %HIM_HER(MASTER,,1)% carrying bunch of underwear that were clearly not %HIS_HERS(MASTER)%!
		PRINTFORML I can't believe it! So my hunch was correct! This %PRINT_MALE("son of a bitch:bitch", MASTER)% befriends bunch of people and then steals their panties!
		PRINTFORML
		PRINTFORML That gotta be it! Gaahhh, for crying out loud, this is such an outrage! And no one seems to do anything about it!
		PRINTFORML It's not that I really care about the pervert or whatever %HE_SHE(MASTER)%'s doing, but as a girl myself I just can't stand by!
		PRINTFORML I feel really grossed out, seriously. I kinda want to turn %HIM_HER(MASTER,,1)% in, but at the same time... Hm.
		PRINTFORML
		PRINTFORML Maybe I should just wait and see. How is %HE_SHE(MASTER)% doing it? Surely %HE_SHE(MASTER)%'s not some master of seduction, right?!
		PRINTFORML That's what I gotta figure out. Even if my panties end up getting stolen too... So be it!
		PRINTFORML It's a necessary sacrifice for the cause!
	CASE 8
		PRINTFORML Dear diary,
		PRINTFORML 
		PRINTFORML Today I got my panties stolen. I guess it's just my luck!
		PRINTFORML I was just minding my own business, and then - poof!
		PRINTFORML I felt a sudden wind in my loins, so I went there to check, and what do you know? They're up and gone!
		PRINTFORML I was soooo ready to just drop dead on the spot from such a humiliation.
		PRINTFORML Me, a great amanojaku! Gets her precious underwear pilfered from her just like that! So what do I do?
		PRINTFORML I just had to carry on! Grr, darn! I mean, what else could I do? Scream my lungs out? Go back home right away? Screw that!
		PRINTFORML I'm gonna find whoever did this, I'm gonna figure out how they did it and then I'm gonna... Hrm. Yeah, that's gonna be something.
		IF CFLAG:[[正邪]]:1302
			PRINTFORML
			PRINTFORML Speaking of which, is it related to that %CALLNAME:MASTER% %PRINT_MALE("guy", MASTER)%, I wonder?
			PRINTFORML I mean, %HE_SHE(MASTER)% also steals underwear somehow too, right?
			PRINTFORML Ohhh, this is getting complicated... If they're one and the same, we got a huuuuge problem on our hands indeed.
		ENDIF
	CASE 9
		PRINTFORML Dear diary,
		PRINTFORML
		PRINTFORML Today I got molested. I'm pretty sure.
		PRINTFORML Now, I have no idea how that happened, at all. I didn't even see the perp.
		PRINTFORML One moment everything was fine, and a second later I was already a soppy mess.
		PRINTFORML I'm not making this up though! I've had his stuff smeared all over me too!
		PRINTFORML Disgusting. Never before I felt myself being this weak and defenseless. I mean...
		PRINTFORML There were some other times, but I have no recollection of this one at all!
		PRINTFORML
		PRINTFORML There's literally nothing I could do. Couldn't stand a chance. And not just me, anyone can suffer the same fate.
		PRINTFORML Man, if I'm being at mercy of some huge ass perv... This is getting scary.
		PRINTFORML At least I can hope that doing petty pervert shit is the upper limit.
		PRINTFORML Because otherwise... No, I don't even want to think about it.
	CASE 10
		PRINTFORMDL The writing here seems very rough and sketchy, as if written in a hurry.
		PRINTFORML
		PRINTFORML That's it
		PRINTFORML I figured it out!!
		PRINTFORML It's %HIM_HER(MASTER,,1)%
		PRINTFORML No doubt about it
		PRINTFORML My body knows...... I know it.... I know the taste, I know the feel...
		PRINTFORML My heart throbs and my body gets hotter when %HE_SHE(MASTER)%'s around
		PRINTFORML I want it
		PRINTFORML Whatever power %HE_SHE(MASTER)%'s using to pull that off, I want it
		PRINTFORML I need it!
		PRINTFORML And I'll get it
		PRINTFORML
		PRINTFORML I always do.
	CASE 11
		PRINTFORML Dear diary,
		PRINTFORML
		PRINTFORML Today I got pissed off really hard.
		PRINTFORML That %PRINT_MALE("guy", MASTER)% I met the other day? Yeah. %HE_SHE(MASTER,1)% was an asshole after all!
		PRINTFORML Dammit! Me and my taste in people, huh. This is the last time I let some human humiliate me like this.
		PRINTFORML Next time I'm just gonna kill %HIM_HER(MASTER,,1)%, no matter what anyone says.
		PRINTFORML Yes, I'll do it! I'll do it! Watch me!
		PRINTFORML ...I'm such a pushover.
	CASE 12
		PRINTFORML Dear diary,
		PRINTFORML
		PRINTFORML Me and %CALLNAME:MASTER%... We went on a date today. At least I'm sure that's how it's called.
		PRINTFORML I go out on my own all the time, but this... felt different.
		PRINTFORML Somehow it left me very exhausted and drained... I couldn't do anything but to follow %HIS_HER(MASTER)% lead, really.
		PRINTFORML I hope it didn't feel too boring for %HIM_HER(MASTER,,1)%. Well, we can always do it again.
		PRINTFORML Or not. It's not too late to go our separate ways at this stage.
		PRINTFORML But, eh... It'll get better, I'm sure.
		PRINTFORML Beats sitting alone being bored all day at least.
	CASE 13
		PRINTFORML Dear diary,
		PRINTFORML
		PRINTFORML I kissed with %CALLNAME:MASTER% for the first time. Well, it was... an interesting experience.
		PRINTFORML I told %HIM_HER(MASTER,,1)% straight up how it felt. I usually don't do that, but something prompted me to do so.
		PRINTFORML I don't know, it just... felt special somehow. My heart was beating so fast, too.
		PRINTFORML It was one of the few things that was still pure about me. And... I don't think it was a wrong move.
		PRINTFORML Everyone has to do it at some point, even me.
		PRINTFORML If I had to choose... This is as good as it gets, honestly.
	CASE 14
		PRINTFORML Dear diary...
		PRINTFORML Sorry, I have to put this one out. I feel bad for dirtying you like this, but...
		PRINTFORML
		PRINTFORML %CALLNAME:MASTER%... %HE_SHE(MASTER, 1)% saw me masturbating today. That's not something I wanted %HIM_HER(MASTER,,1)% to see though...
		PRINTFORML Well, it might be my fault for doing it so often lately, but...
		PRINTFORML %HE_SHE(MASTER,1)% should've at least had the decency to knock first! I can't believe %HE_SHE(MASTER)% just barged in like that!
		PRINTFORML %HE_SHE(MASTER,1)%'ll totally think that I'm a huge pervert now.
		PRINTFORML ...Well, maybe I am.
		PRINTFORML Gaahh...!
		PRINTFORML I didn't need anyone else to know this side of me! This blows!
	CASE 15
		PRINTFORMDL You see weird sticky drips all over this page, as if Seija... was masturbating while writing this.
		PRINTFORML
		PRINTFORML Dear diary...
		PRINTFORML
		PRINTFORML More and more strange things keep happening to me. Today... I ended up growing a dick.
		PRINTFORML It just appeared out of nowhere. I feel deeply perturbed, to say the least.
		PRINTFORML I'm a girl! I'm not supposed to have this thing! It's gross, it gets in the way and it stinks.
		PRINTFORML Yet... It feels good. I lost myself jerking off until I knocked myself out.
		PRINTFORML I'm ashamed to say that I can now relate to whatever perverts must feel. How men get crazy all the time.
		PRINTFORML It's not something you can control. At all. And I feel like it's making me change.
		PRINTFORML I don't like it, but my body seems to welcome it. I guess... I'm stuck with this thing for a while.
	CASE 25
		PRINTFORML Dear diary,
		PRINTFORML
		PRINTFORML Thinking back, this is embarrassing, but I don't care. I just masturbated all night today.
		PRINTFORML Somehow one way or another I got involved in a physical relationship with that human I mentioned.
		PRINTFORML Yeah, it escapes me too. I can't wrap my head around it. We're just using each other for cheap, disposable pleasure.
		PRINTFORML And I'm, well... Honestly fine with it. I think I should do it more.
	CASE 27
		PRINTFORML Dear diary,
		PRINTFORML
		PRINTFORML I dunno what happened today. Today I felt sort of... weird. It's like I felt butterflies in my stomach whenever I'm around %HIM_HER(MASTER,,1)%.
		PRINTFORML I have a bad feeling about this. I should stay away before it gets worse, but I just... can't help but be attracted to %HIM_HER(MASTER,,1)%.
		PRINTFORML %HE_SHE(MASTER,1)% seems to enjoy my company too. Unbelievable. And weird. We're both weirdos, apparently.
		PRINTFORML I was already a mess before, but now I'm totally confused.
		PRINTFORML For some reason I started sleeping better. Probably because it gets me so exhausted.
		PRINTFORML I don't know, but maybe it's that. That thing every girl talks about. We'll see.

			PRINTFORML Or at least that's what I think it is. This %PRINT_MALE("guy", MASTER)%, %CALLNAME:MASTER%... %HE_SHE(MASTER,1)% pisses me off!

		PRINTFORML Because I'm sure I'm not %HIS_HER(MASTER)% number one, right? It's me we're talking about. No way, right?
		PRINTFORML
		PRINTFORML I'm just a fun little distraction from other, far prettier girls who seem to flock near %HIM_HER(MASTER,,1)% all the time.
		PRINTFORML Yeah.
		PRINTFORML I wouldn't have it any other way.
		PRINTFORML Don't wanna be in the spotlight.
