PRINTPLAIN TIPS: 
PRINTDATA
	DATAFORM There are some commands that can't be executed unless they're in the spot.
	DATAFORM If you click the【★】next to someone's name, the【Follow】command will take you to them.
	DATAFORM Some maps lack gardening and training facilities. Move if you need to.
	DATAFORM To get better at stopping time, practice a lot.
	DATAFORM To find lost items, ask someone who is good at it.
	DATAFORM Alcohol can be bought at the liquor store.
	DATAFORM Depending on the results of fortune telling or omikuji, some things change. Lottery, Casino, and skills like Foraging are influenced to some extent.
	DATAFORM Snow makes crops grow slower.
	DATAFORM Charisma is a currency that can be used at the Scarlet Devil Mansion's casino.
	DATAFORM Paying with money rather than Charisma is generally sounder.
	DATAFORM Some characters have unique commands.
	DATAFORM If Combat and Knowledge are low, raising favorability will be hard.
	DATAFORM Pray to god and everything will turn alright in the end.
	DATAFORM Random characters can be found at the square in the Human Village.
	DATAFORM Random characters' stats raise quickly but only on the first day.
	DATAFORM A forgotten random character will never come back.
	DATAFORM When a random character comes back, they will no longer improve as fast and they won't get pregnant.
	DATAFORM No more than one random characters can exist at once.
	DATAFORM Information about random characters is stored in the dat folder.
	DATAFORM A random character will not appear again unless it's the same location as last time.
	DATAFORM When abstinence becomes too much to bear, let it all out and find peace.
	DATAFORM As some characters are nocturnal, changing the alarm clock is important to meet them.
	DATAFORM Is a command not displaying? It may be filtered.
	DATAFORM Incompetent mode blocks some actions, but it is much easier to be pushed down.
	DATAFORM Before some characters can be helped during work, certain conditions must be fulfilled. But for some it may be impossible.
	DATAFORM Ingredients are needed to cook stuff.
	DATAFORM Put water in the jar with the sake bug to create sake.
	DATAFORM Rotors can be grown in gardens.
	DATAFORM If smell resistance is too high it'll become hard to clean.
	DATAFORM Membership rank rises by playing and losing lots at the casino.
	DATAFORM When rape mark is on the same level as pleasure- and lewd marks, they have a special effect. Even hard-to-get characters will melt.
	DATAFORM Collector's gaps are replenished over time, but there is an upper limit on how many can be carried at once. Make sure to use them.
	DATAFORM There are places that cannot be entered without fulfilling certain conditions, like abilities and relations.
	DATAFORM Training and studying with others is more effective.
	DATAFORM Denial mode suppresses climax, this is to help triggering stronger and multiple ones.
	DATAFORM After borrowing books at Suzunaan, experience increases faster depending on the book. 
	DATAFORM The Stone of Mirada makes it easier to get lust and pushing people down. Intimacy and reliance become difficult to increase however.
	DATAFORM If you play for more than a year, you can use BAITSA・DASUTO to start over while keeping some things.
	DATAFORM Reaching climax at the same time multiplies the pleasure by the strength of the ejaculation.
	DATAFORM 3 days of abstinence gives【Thick Semen】, but the day following ejaculation【Thick Semen】will be lost.
	DATAFORM Abstinence makes you stressed and gives you wet dreams.
	DATAFORM Getting a score greater than 80 when cooking increases their mood, lower than 35 lowers it.
	DATAFORM Increasing desire for Tsukumogami is hard, but the impregnation chance increases the more you use tools.
	DATAFORM It's hard to increase favorability when reliability is low. This limitation does not apply during dates.
	DATAFORM During childcare, sexual frustration is capped. But if the child goes to school or is sleeping...
	DATAFORM Even without mixing supplies, it can still be done in a few places.
	DATAFORM Mixing Lv along with Knowledge increases mixing success rate.
	DATAFORM Please stop playing instruments when people are working.
	DATAFORM Some materials can only be foraged during certain seasons.
	DATAFORM Foraging with higher foraging level gives better materials.
	DATAFORM Performing at a banquet can give be quite rewarding, but if the performance is poor, then... 
	DATAFORM Praying for characters means they will visit the next day.
	DATAFORM Work schedules can be checked from the abilities screen and the calendar.
	DATAFORM Some characters can have their images changed in the ability screen or image settings.
	DATAFORM If you click on the person you are targeting, it will switch between the face and body pictures.
	DATAFORM Some materials can be bought from certain characters.
	DATAFORM 【Fairies】like「Nature」gifts.
	DATAFORM Those who are【Childish】like「Namesake」gifts.
	DATAFORM Most like「Spell Card」gifts aside from those without fighting ability.
	DATAFORM 【Youkai】and【Ghosts】generally hate「Divination」and「Buddhist」gifts.
	DATAFORM No one likes「Inferior」gifts.
	DATAFORM 「Black Magic」,「Bone」,「Blood」, and「Poison」gifts are usually disliked by everyone who isn't a Youkai.
	DATAFORM During holidays, the sales and profit margin of street vendors go up.
	DATAFORM Vegetables sell well in the Underworld.
	DATAFORM Fish sell well at the Youkai Mountain Summit.
	;The following are original ones
	DATAFORM A good date can take care of hate marks.
	DATAFORM Struggling to fish or forage? Your personal luck score may be too low. Perhaps a certain someone can help collect your misfortune...
	DATAFORM If you feel unwell, ask Eirin at Eientei to help you, or even relieve you. Sometimes her services go a bit too far however...
	DATAFORM Your skills can make a big difference if you decide to help someone with their job.
	DATAFORM Think twice if you want to play an instrument with poor skill in front of someone who can kick your ass.
	DATAFORM If you want to learn how to cook better and fast, consider helping Miyoi in Geidontei at Human Village, or Mystia with her food stall.
	DATAFORM There's two types of luck - daily fortune, and personal luck. Both provide benefits, but may also spell certain doom.
	DATAFORM Every day starts with a different stroke of personal luck. Perhaps the rabbit that favors fortune has an item that will help you sense it...
	DATAFORM What is luck if not a little special something for every single thing you do? One must not underestimate it...
	DATAFORM Fortune remains neutral until you try to poke into it more. It can be good, yet also devastating...
	DATAFORM Turning down girls when they confess can be heartbreaking. Perhaps letting them go away when they're sleepy is a better way...?
	DATAFORM Being good friends with certain characters can bring about all sort of useful perks.
	DATAFORM Rumor has it that you gain special privileges at Suzunaan if you get along with its mistress... She may even let you borrow a special book.
	DATAFORM Foraging for ingredients and selling them at Eientei is a great way to make some money.
	DATAFORM Opening a stall during festivals and holidays can be quite lucrative.
	DATAFORM Make sure to track the Charisma market every now and then. Buy high, sell low!
	DATAFORM When helping other characters, some works can be accomplished during Time Stop. Use it to your advantage to practice your skills!
	DATAFORM The more you read the tutorial, the better your sleep will become if you have the [Sweet Sleep Pillow]... Most of the time.
